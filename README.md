This is the factory flash firmware backed up from the factory-firmware-esp32-s3-parallel-tft-with-touch-7-inch in September 2024

Specifically it is the firmware for the item sold here

I have saved this bin file (untested but has been verified) to provide it to anyone else who might need it as part of a disaster recovery process as a form of factory reset.

I couldn't find this bin file available in the Makerfabs github repository so I am providing it here.
